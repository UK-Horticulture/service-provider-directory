# Geographic Agricultural Service Provider Directory of Kentucky v1.0

This repository holds code and data for generating a dynamic, interactive point map of resources related to agricultural service providers across the state of Kentucky.  Earlier iterations of this map were developed to comply with coursework assignments for the New Maps Plus curriculum and Extension projects at the University of Kentucky.  The functional difference between earlier versions and this version is to streamline the UX for smaller screen mobile devices without sacrificing critical functionality for desktop users and to use a different dataset.

This map has been initialized with a geocoded .csv file generated using QGIS from raw data provided by the KY Governor's Office of Agricultural Policy for Educational Greenhouses and Shared Equipment from the County Agricultural Investment Program (CAIP), University of Kentucky Cooperative Extension, and the Kentucky Horticulture Council.  

Tooltips for individual data categories can be customized to show / not show information specific to the datatype, making this a very flexible platform.
