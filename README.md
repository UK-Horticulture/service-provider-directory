# Geographic Horticulture Directory of Kentucky v2.0

This repository holds code and data for generating a dynamic, interactive point map of resources related to horticultural activity across the state of Kentucky.  Earlier versions of this map were developed to comply with coursework assignments for the New Maps Plus curriculum at the University of Kentucky.  The functional difference between earlier versions and this version is to streamline the UX for smaller screen mobile devices without sacrificing critical functionality for desktop users.

This map has been initialized with a geocoded .csv file generated using QGIS from raw data provided by the KY Governor's Office of Agricultural Policy for Educational Greenhouses and Shared Equipment from the County Agricultural Investment Program (CAIP).  It is scalable to easily add new data types / icons for Produce Auctions, Farmers' Markets and other resources TBD.

Tooltips for individual data categories can be customized to show / not show information specific to the datatype, making this a very flexible platform.
